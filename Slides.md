# Why

* idea floated around
* there were some previous meetups and events around go,
e.g. [Ready to
Go](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Softwerkskammer-Leipzig/events/245523279/)
(04/2018), [devopenspace 2018](https://devopenspace.de/) (10/2018) and more.

# Idea

Join forces, combine Go and Cloud, just start and see where this goes.

# Go

* [The eigenvector of "Why we moved from language X to language Y"](https://erikbern.com/2017/03/15/the-eigenvector-of-why-we-moved-from-language-x-to-language-y.html) (2017)

> I took the stochastic matrix sorted by the future popularity of the language (as predicted by the first eigenvector).

# Go

> Surprisingly, (to me, at least) Go is the big winner here. There’s a ton of
> search results for people moving from X to Go. I’m not even sure how I feel
> about it (I have mixed feelings about Go) but I guess my infallible analysis
> points to the inevitable conclusion that Go is something worth watching.
